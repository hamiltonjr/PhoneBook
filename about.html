										<h2>About me</h2>
										<p>A mathematician and systems engineer passionately for programming, literature, and well-living things.</p>
									</header>
									<p>My name is Hamilton Gonçalves Junior. I graduated in Mathematics in the 1990s and in Information Systems now in 2018. I was always in love with Computing at the beginning as a hobby. I always liked Classical Literature. And when you learn a lot of things, you become smarter and start liking to live well and all that is related.</p>

									<p>I studied mathematics at the University of São Paulo, São Carlos campus, at the Institute of Mathematical and Computer Sciences. I worked in many places later, in banks, hotels and schools. After being mature, I decided to study Information Systems at the same institute. I met old friends and it was very good.</p>

									<p>Now I'm looking for a job. I work as a freelancer. I have interest in Java, Python and programming for Android. But I like web programming too (I like all about programming). I am currently studying these things and developing some of what I have already learned.</p>

									<p>From the classics of Brazilian Literature and World Literature I've read a lot. I'm slowly rereading some important works and I have many others to read. I have occupation for life, certainly.</p>

									<p>About well-being, well, I'm living. I try to keep my friendships up to date and make new ones, always worried about the quality of these relationships. I'm a little lazy to do exercises, but I know they're important and that's why I do it anyway. I have made a lighter diet and made breaks during working hours. It is a tendency today for people to take care of body and soul: I am getting more involved in this tendency. Anyway, I'm a happy person.</p>

									<h2>Things I Can Do</h2>
									<h3 id="write-all">Write all the code</h3>
									<p>I'm a full-stack developer: I like taking care of all the code. I have a feeling that it will not be very good if many people take care of the same project. I think this is the craze of those who did not work on big projects. I hope to lose this craze soon.</p>
									<h3 id="read-books">Read books and stuff</h3>
									<p>As a lover of Literature, I read everything that appears ahead, giving preference to my beloved classics. My first world class was Hamlet. After that I could not stop reading, because these are hours of delight and learning.</p>
									<h3 id="drink-coffee">Drink much coffee</h3>
									<p>Coffee seems to be the fuel of programmers. I have already been told that it is wrong, and that it is good. I feel quite drained when I have a good cup of coffee. In Brazil, coffee is tradition, and has very good coffee around here. Can not resist!</p>
									<h3 id="much-more">And much more...</h3>
									<p>For my potential contractors I want to say that I'm work weel in a team. I have good communication skills, talking and writing. I have some practice to use office tools. Other details can be found in my LinkedIn.</p>
